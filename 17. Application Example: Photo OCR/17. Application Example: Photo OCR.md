# 17. Application Example: Photo OCR
# Photo OCR
## 17.1 Problem Description and Pipeline
- Photo OCR은 Photo Optical Character Recognition의 줄임말임.
### Photo OCR pipeline
- Photo OCR은 1. Text detection 2. Character Segmentaion 3. Character classification (4. Spelling correction) 순으로 이루어짐.
- Text detection: go through the image and find the regions where there's text and image.
- Character segmenation: given the rectangle around the text region, try to segment it out into the locations of the individual characters.
- Character classification: run a classifier.

## 17.2 Sliding Windows
- Sliding Window라는 rectangle를 만들어서, 이미지를 sliding하며 example를 수집.
- 수집된 example들에 지도학습을 적용시켜 학습시킴.
- text detection 역시 이러한 식으로 학습.
- 먼저는 sliding windows로 text를 detect하고, white region(detected text region)을 expands함.
- Character segmentaion은 두 문자 사이에 split이 존재하는지 아닌지 지도학습을 통해 학습시킴. (split이 존재하면 positive, 존재하지 않으면 negative)
- 마지막으로 Character classification을 실행 (지도학습 적용).
## 17.3 Getting Lots of Data and Artificial Data
### Artificial data synthesis for photo OCR
- E.g. Using free font library
    - take characters from different fonts and paste these characters against different random backgrounds.
### Synthesizing data by introducing distortions
- Distortion introduced should be representation of the type of noise/distortions in the test set.
- Usually does not help to add purely random/meaningless noise to your data.
### Discussion on getting more data
1. Sanity Check: Make sure you have a low bias classifier before expending the effort. (Plot learning curves). E.g. keep increasing the number of features/number of hidden units in neural network until you have a low bias classifier.
2. "How much work would it be to get 10x as much data as we currently have?"
    - Artificial data synthesis
    - Collect/label it yourself
    - "Crowd source" (E.g. Amazon Mechanical Turk)
## 17.4 Ceiling Analysis: What Part of the Pipeline to Work on Next
### Estimating the errors due to each component (ceiling analysis)
- What part of the pipeline should you spend the most time trying to improve?
- Overall pipeline의 accuracy를 계산해보고, 각 component의 accuracy를 계산해봄.
- 가장 큰 폭으로 accuracy를 증가시킬 수 있는 component에 집중하여 시간을 쓰는게 효율적임.
